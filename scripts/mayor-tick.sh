# Deterministic merge-PR pipeline + dashboard.md refresh for the mayor method.
#
# Replaces the mayor's per-turn model-driven work for the old 5m merge-PR
# loop and 10m dashboard-refresh loop. Session-log analysis
# (session 534747a7) showed those two loops firing on a tight cadence doing
# fully deterministic work -- queue drain, PR verdict parse, gh pr merge,
# post-merge cleanup, dashboard bookkeeping -- none of which needs a model
# turn. This script does that work; the mayor only wakes up when the exit
# code says there's a judgment call left.
#
# Split point: this script does `ls
# .claude/review-queue`, `gh pr list --json`, review-verdict parse, `gh pr
# merge` on gated CLEAN/BEHIND PRs, post-merge `git pull`/prune/worktree/branch
# cleanup, a self-heal reconciliation pass for any open worker PR the
# SubagentStop hook never queued at all, and the deterministic
# slices of ai/dashboard.md. The mayor still does: dispatching
# critical-reviewer for undrained queue entries (this script cannot invoke a
# Claude subagent), cluster-shape decisions on new `bd ready` beads, and
# investigating anything below couldn't gate cleanly.
#
# Exit code taxonomy (OR-able -- if multiple signals fire, the HIGHEST wins):
#   0  = noop, nothing for the mayor to do this tick.
#   10 = new dispatchable beads in `bd ready` -- mayor picks cluster shape
#        and dispatches workers.
#   20 = a merge/gate exception (CLEAN/BEHIND PR with no qualifying review,
#        or a needs-changes/needs-discussion verdict) OR undrained
#        review-queue entries (PR or non-PR) -- mayor investigates or
#        dispatches critical-reviewer.
#   30 = a worker worktree/branch with no PR at all -- mayor investigates.
#
# State file: .claude/mayor-tick-state.json (path overridable via
# MAYOR_TICK_STATE_FILE for tests). Written on every run; this is what the
# mayor reads to decide follow-up action without re-deriving any of it.
#
# MAYOR_TICK_DRY_RUN=1 turns every side-effecting external command (gh pr
# merge, git worktree remove, git branch -D, rm of a queue file, git pull/
# prune) into a logged no-op -- see run_cmd(). Used by this script's own
# test suite (scripts/test-mayor-tick-logic.sh) so tests never touch a real
# PR, worktree, or branch.
#
# Testability: `mayor-tick.sh __call <fn> [args...]` invokes a single
# function from this file and exits -- lets the test suite exercise the
# REAL pure functions (verdict parsing, timestamp comparison, exit-code
# selection, state-JSON construction) as a subprocess, the same convention
# scripts/test-check-bead-id-refs-logic.sh and siblings use, without
# needing network access or a live gh/bd session.

# Step 0: drain the review queue. This is NOT reviewer dispatch (this
# script cannot invoke a Claude subagent) -- it only confirms whether a
# queue entry's deliverable already got reviewed since it was queued, and
# if so removes the queue file (rm, not mv-to-processed/ -- the audit
# trail is git history plus the review posted on the PR itself, both
# durable and both outside .claude/). Anything still undrained stays
# queued for the mayor to dispatch critical-reviewer against.
#
# Only `pr` deliverables get an automated drain check: `gh pr view` gives
# an unambiguous per-review submittedAt to compare against queued_at.
# `findings`/`bead-close`/`bead-supersede` deliverables post to bd notes
# instead (see .claude/agents/critical-reviewer.md's "Output & posting"),
# and bd's CLI exposes no per-note timestamp; a bead-supersede ref can also
# legitimately resolve to either of two beads. Self-confirming those risks
# a false "drained" against the wrong bead's unrelated update, so they are
# always surfaced in PENDING_NON_PR_REVIEWS for the mayor to confirm by
# hand instead of silently sitting undrained with no visibility.

# Step 6: self-heal reconciliation. Compensating layer for the

# exiting with an error) -- without this, an open worker PR with no queue
# entry AND no review sits invisible to the mayor until a manual audit
# catches it. Runs after process_review_queue so pr_already_queued sees
# this tick's queue state. Logged with the "mayor-tick reconcile:" prefix
# (distinct from process_review_queue's hook-fed path) so an audit can tell
# script-detected self-heal from hook-queued.
#
# Also covers a narrower gap: a PR that already has a review, but that
# review is a stale BLOCKING verdict (needs-changes/needs-discussion) and
# commits landed on the head branch after it was submitted -- fixed, but
# never re-reviewed, because the hook only fires from a worker's own
# SubagentStop and this fix can land any other way (a direct push, or a
# hook miss). A real queue file (not just an in-memory pending_reviews
# entry) is written for this case specifically: writing it means
# pr_already_queued's existing no-double-queue guard also covers THIS
# branch on every subsequent tick, so a re-review that comes back blocking
# again does not requeue every tick forever -- it only requeues once a
# genuinely NEW commit lands after that re-review's own submittedAt.
#
# That queue file's name is derived from the PR number + the review's own
# submittedAt, not wall-clock time: this script runs on a 15m cron AND can
# be invoked inline on a task notification, so two overlapping runs
# reconciling the SAME PR is real, not hypothetical. Both racing processes
# observe the identical latest review and so compute the identical name;
# the noclobber write below (_write_file_contents_if_absent) then lets only
# the first one through instead of both writing distinct duplicate files.
