# Pre-push gate: enforces word budgets on durable docs as a RATCHET.
#
# Why words and not lines (measured 2026-08-21): line count is not invariant
# under reflow, so an agent that hits a line cap can join lines and pass with
# zero content change. Worse, it already misranks the corpus — at the time of
# writing docs/decisions/proto-adapter-codegen.md was 36 lines / 569 words
# (185 chars/line) while install-script-ux.md was 56 lines / 420 words
# (60 chars/line), so a 45-line budget would have passed the longer document
# and failed the shorter one. `wc -w` is invariant under reflow, line joining,
# indentation and blank lines. It is also the unit the rest of the project
# already uses (mayor-dispatch-template.md caps returns at 300/400 words),
# and at ~1.3 tokens/word it tracks the cost this gate exists to control.
#
# RATCHET, not ceiling: a file over budget may shrink or hold, never grow.
# Pre-existing debt therefore never wedges a push, and compression work is
# never blocked. Only accretion fails.
#
# Fenced code blocks are excluded from the count — code is not prose verbosity.
# `kind: postmortem` docs are exempt: they record an incident at a point in
# time and are not maintained down (see ai/extended-context/README.md).
#
# Deliberately NOT enforced: line width. Words are reflow-invariant, so wrap
# style cannot affect this gate; adding a wrap rule would only conflate a
# formatting proxy with a content measure again.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-doc-budget.sh [base-ref]   (default: origin/main)

# custom-bin 306), not to the corpus mean — 400 is ~30% above that cluster.
#
# ai/dashboard.md also carries a ~40-line ceiling in mayor-bootstrap.md. That rule
# is about fitting one screen so a returning operator re-orients fast; this
# one is about content volume. They are complementary — a dashboard reflowed
# to 20 long lines would satisfy the line rule and still be bloated.
