# SubagentStop hook: detects reviewable deliverables in a subagent's final
# message and queues a review request under .claude/review-queue/.
#
# Design shape (2026-08-18): dumb-but-certain queueing, NOT auto-dispatch.
#   - The hook DEFINITELY fires (writes file) once a deliverable is seen.
#   - Mayor picks up the queue file on next turn and invokes
#     `.claude/agents/critical-reviewer.md` to actually review.
#   - Chose queueing over inline `claude -p` because upstream
#     anthropics/claude-code#27755 reports SubagentStop hooks configured via
#     settings.json are unreliable, and blocking the parent loop for a full
#     reviewer run (up to 600s hook timeout) would stall session throughput.
#
# Never spawn a reviewer synchronously from here. Never edit files outside
# .claude/review-queue/.
#
# Retention policy (2026-08-27): decisions.tsv rotates via simple counter
# rotation (.tsv -> .1 -> .2, oldest generation discarded)
# once it reaches ~1 MiB, so a long-running mayor session cannot grow it
# unbounded. Both "queued" and "skip" entries rotate together -- skips are
# already the majority of lines and untangling the two isn't worth the
# complexity. Queued (auditable) entries survive at least two rotations
# before being dropped, since nothing is discarded until it ages past the
# .2 generation.
#
# Empty-agent_type filter (2026-08-27): a SubagentStop payload with an
# empty (not missing) agent_type is a spurious harness event per upstream
# anthropics/claude-code#27755 (closed not-planned) -- confirmed by a
# 2026-08-27 investigation into a ~32-33s empty-agent_type firing cadence
# with no backing transcript, invisible in the mayor's own turn loop. Every
# genuine deliverable-bearing payload populates agent_type, so this case
# never carries a reviewable message; exit before mkdir/log/anything else.
#
# Branch-lookup PR fallback (2026-08-27): a worker resumed via SendMessage
# after a needs-changes fix typically reports "New commit <sha> on PR #<N>"
# instead of the full PR URL the primary regex below matches, so the hook
# used to skip these with no-deliverable and the mayor had to notice the
# gap manually. If nothing else matches for a worker payload, ask GitHub
# for an open PR on that worker's own branch before giving up.

# proceeds if `kill -0` confirms that PID is no longer running. A missing
