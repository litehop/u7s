# Shared by scripts/test-check-bead-id-refs-logic.sh and

# Internal (underscore-prefixed, same convention as
# scripts/conformance/_lib.sh): source this, don't run it directly.
#
# GIT_* variables that redirect git's chosen repository/working-tree/index/
# object-store/config location if inherited from an enclosing process. Both
# test suites above run their sandbox-repo helpers (`git init`/`git
# config`/`git commit` against disposable fixture dirs) from inside
# .githooks/pre-commit and .githooks/pre-push respectively -- exactly the
# ambient environment whose GIT_DIR/GIT_CONFIG leakage already corrupted the
# mayor's real repository twice (a sandbox fixture's `git init`/`git commit`
# inherited the enclosing hook's ambient var and landed in the real repo
# instead of a disposable sandbox). Every git subprocess the sandbox-repo
# helpers spawn MUST go through run_git() to strip these first, or the
# sandbox dir this whole test's safety story depends on could be silently
# ignored in favor of whatever the enclosing hook invocation's environment
# happens to point at.
#
# Also sourced by scripts/sensitive-conformance-gate.sh and its test harness
# scripts/test-sensitive-conformance-gate-logic.sh (PR #1408 predates this
# shared file and originally kept its own inline copy of the identical
# wrapper; consolidated here once this file existed). See
# crates/junit-reuse-check/src/lib.rs's git_command() doc comment for the
# full per-variable rationale, including why HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME are
# deliberately NOT in this list.
