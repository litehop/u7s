# Unit test for scripts/gh-app-token.sh's JWT-minting and fail-loud guards.
#
# CI has no real litehop-reviewer App key, so this test generates a
# throwaway RSA key with openssl genrsa and shadows curl with a stub earlier
# on PATH that captures the Authorization header GitHub would have received
# and returns canned installation/access-token JSON -- exercising the REAL
# script as a subprocess, not a reimplementation of its JWT-building logic.
# This is the same PATH-shadow-a-binary technique scripts/test-critical-
# reviewer-hook.sh already uses for `gh` (the plan's cited precedent,
# test-check-doc-budget-logic.sh, does no curl/binary stubbing at all -- it
# exercises git directly, so this file establishes the pattern for curl
# rather than following an existing one).
#
# Five assertions, each named for what breaks if it regresses:
#   1. The minted JWT verifies against the throwaway key's public half.
#   2. base64url encoding contains no '+', '/', or '='.
#   3. exp - iat <= 600 and iat < now (GitHub's 10-minute JWT cap).
#   4. A missing APP_ID or unreadable key file exits non-zero with stderr
#      output AND EMPTY STDOUT. A mutation self-check proves this actually
#      matters: with the ${VAR:?} guard softened to a silent default, the
#      same stubbed backend (which never validates the JWT's issuer) happily
#      returns a token anyway -- exactly the silent-empty-token bug that
#      would make GH_TOKEN="" fall back to the operator's own gh credentials.
#   5. stdout is exactly one line, the token -- the caller does
#      GH_TOKEN=$(scripts/gh-app-token.sh), so any stray diagnostic line on
#      stdout poisons the token.
#
# Exits 0 on success, 1 on any assertion failure.
