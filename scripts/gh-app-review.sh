# The natural shape for this -- GH_TOKEN="$(scripts/gh-app-token.sh)" gh api
# ... -X POST --input - -- is unconditionally refused by the sandbox that
# invokes these scripts: its allowlist matches a command's first token, and
# a VAR="$(cmd)" assignment is not an allowlisted binary. This wrapper's
# first token is scripts/..., which is allowlisted, so it mints the token
# internally (composing with, not reimplementing, gh-app-token.sh) and POSTs
# itself.
#
# Keeping the mint and the POST in one process is also better secret hygiene
# than the interpolation idiom would have been: the token never sits on a
# shell command line (visible in a transcript or to `ps`), on stdout, or in
# an error path. It is handed to curl via a stdin-fed config file
# (`curl -K -`), never as a command-line argument.
#
# Usage:
#   jq -n '{body:"...",event:"REQUEST_CHANGES"}' | scripts/gh-app-review.sh <pr-number>
